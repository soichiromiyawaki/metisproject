This is my project for data science class.
This project is about the prediction and recommendation systems of Netflix.

What is the question you hope to answer?
- How can I predict the film's rate?
- Can I make a recommendation system for Netflix users?

What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
- https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data#combined_data_1.txt

What do you know about the data you're using so far?
- The data has MovieIDs, CustomerIDs, Ratings, and Dates.

Why did you choose this topic?
- I can clean the datasets and analyze them by using pandas and visualization. After clean up the data, I can make a prediction model to predict the film's data. In addition, I can analyze the tends of user and make a recommendation system.
